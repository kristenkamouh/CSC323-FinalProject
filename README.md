## 🏗️ Classes Overview

### Abstract Classes
- **Members**: Base class for all gym members with abstract methods for discount calculation and benefits

### Concrete Classes
- **RegularMembers**: Basic gym members with standard access
- **PremiumMembers**: Enhanced members with personal trainer sessions and nutrition consultations
- **Coach**: Staff members specializing in different training types
- **Dietician**: Nutrition specialists providing meal plans and consultations
- **Gym**: Main class managing all members, staff, and plans
- **MembershipPlan**: Defines membership types and pricing

### Interfaces
- **IMembershipPlan**: Contract for membership plan implementations
- **IStaffMembers**: Contract for all staff member types
- **IGym**: Contract for gym operations

### Value Objects
- **Email**: Email validation and management
- **PhoneNumber**: Phone number validation with country codes

### Enums
- **PlanType**: BasicAccess, PremiumAccess
- **CoachType**: CrossFit, PowerLifter, PersonalTrainer, Lifestyle
- **DieticianType**: WeightLoss

## 📊 UML Diagram

The complete UML class diagram for this project can be found in the `/UML` directory:
- **File**: `GymManagementSystem_UML.png`
- **Path**: `/UML/GymManagementSystem_UML`

The UML diagram shows:
- Class relationships and inheritance hierarchy
- Interface implementations
- Composition relationships between classes
- All properties and methods for each class
- Enum definitions and their relationships

Please refer to the UML diagram for a visual representation of the class structure and relationships implemented in this project.

## 🎯 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. **Inheritance**
- `RegularMembers` and `PremiumMembers` inherit from abstract `Members` class
- `Coach` and `Dietician` implement `IStaffMembers` interface

### 2. **Polymorphism**
- Abstract methods `CalculateDiscount()` and `GetMembershipBenefits()` implemented differently in derived classes
- Interface methods implemented by multiple classes

### 3. **Abstraction**
- Abstract `Members` class defines common structure
- Interfaces define contracts without implementation

### 4. **Encapsulation**
- Properties with getters and setters
- Validation logic encapsulated in value objects
- Business logic contained within appropriate classes

### 5. **Composition**
- `Members` class contains `Email` and `PhoneNumber` objects
- `Gym` class contains collections of members and staff


## 🎓 Academic Context

This project is designed for Computer Science coursework to demonstrate:
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Class design and relationships
- Interface implementation
- Abstract class usage
- Enum definitions
- Basic validation techniques
- Windows Forms application structure

## 📝 Notes

- This is a simplified implementation for academic purposes
- Error handling is basic and can be enhanced
- No database integration - uses in-memory collections
- UI implementation is minimal, focusing on the class structure
- Validation is simplified for demonstration purposes
